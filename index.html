<p>This blog is where I will be putting the things I do while including desriptions and pictures.</p>

<h3 id="java-script-joystick">Java Script Joystick</h3>

<p>We created a robot called “EvoCar” which is a 3D Printed Arduino and Raspberry Pi controlled car with a 6 servo robotic arm on top. In order to control the car we had created a webpage with buttons, up, down, left, right, and stop. But, clicking the buttons repeatedly, was getting very tedious. To solve this problem we created a <a href="https://sooraj-gupta.github.io/joystick/joystick.html">joystick</a>.</p>

<p>This joystick allows us to set/increase/decrease to any speed within range for both the X and Y axes simultaneously. The webpage sends continuously sends a left speed and right speed for the car. The calculation for these speeds is adding/subtracting the X value to/from the Y value. The adding or subtracting is based on which way the X axis is moved, left or right of the center. - (7/19/20)</p>

<h3 id="cooking-website">Cooking Website</h3>

<p>Multi-Page Website using HTML, CSS and a bit of JavaScript.
Includes media queries so that it can be compatible with smaller screens such as mobile devices.  - (7/25/20)</p>

<h3 id="foot-pedal-hand-sanitizer-dispenser">Foot Pedal Hand Sanitizer Dispenser</h3>

<p>One of the main concerns of COVID-19 or any virus in general is the spread through surfaces that many people touch. Everyone always says, “use hand sanitizer” to try to lower the chances for any spread. However, in the majority of places such as doctor’s offices, schools, and even homes, the only type of hand sanitizer dispenser are the ones where you must press the top of the bottle with your hand in order to squeeze out the liquid, which defeats the purpose of “sanitizing.” Although there are many hands free dispensers with motion sensors, they can be expensive and harder to buy multiple. I designed a 3D printed foot operated dispenser using Fusion 360, with the additional parts only being a PVC pipe and a string. - (8/16/20)</p>
