							<p class = "font small">I attempted to create an Arduino controlled system which was to take the live video feed from a camera and light up a 10x10 array of LEDs resembling the camera input. The first step was to pixelate the camera feed to 10x10 and convert to greyscale. I did this using Processing by using the camera input and then splitting the width by 10 and the height by 10 and then getting the average color for each square. Then, I printed out the greyscale value for each square from 0-100 in a 10x10 array.</p>

I tested this out with 4 LEDs in a 2x2 array. and instead of splitting the camera input into 10x10 I split it into 2x2. Then, using the Arduino, I sent the greyscale value for each square to the respective LED. This was the result:</p>

Everyone always says, “use hand sanitizer” to try to lower the chances for any spread. However, in the majority of places such as doctor’s offices, schools, and even homes, the only type of hand sanitizer dispenser are the ones where you must press the top of the bottle with your hand in order to squeeze out the liquid, which defeats the purpose of “sanitizing.” Although there are many hands free dispensers with motion sensors, they can be expensive and harder to buy multiple. I designed a 3D printed foot operated dispenser using Fusion 360, with the additional parts only being a PVC pipe and a string. (July 27, 2020)</p>
